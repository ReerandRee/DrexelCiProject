Many of our new initiatives eventually become standard across the industry and we have thus established a reputation as being a thought-leader in our industry. \n\n Role & Responsibilities \n\n Labatt’s developers create and continuously improve all the systems that run the business. Software and data analytics play a huge part in the success of the company, and therefore software developers have a significant impact on the company. Since the very beginning, Labatt has focused on writing all of its own code, allowing the company to move quickly into new areas and be flexible to customer needs. Our team of software developers design, test, and continually re-engineer the critical systems that keep all aspects of the business running at full steam. Developers work as members of small teams, and employ Agile methodologies to bring about the internal-efficiency and customer-facing innovations that are necessary to keep our lead in the industry. Our philosophy of investing in clean code and developing people from within allows us to build for the long term and leverage the most forward-thinking APIs, languages, and practices, to take on the most intellectually challenging projects that our industry faces. \n\n As a software developer at Labatt, you will take on projects approximately 6 months in length, iterate on a small team of 3-5, test thoroughly, design clean & modular code, experiment, learn, be challenged, and serve the needs of the business. All developers are expected to contribute to the team's success by solving significant problems and sharing lessons learned with the group. Developers are also expected to follow the group's established coding and process best practices as established by the group to ensure quality and consistent code— code that will last for many years. Developers have a significant amount of freedom with their projects and the ability to experiment with newer technologies and practices that may help the group overall. \n\n Our Current Stack \n\n Developers at Labatt Food Service use a variety of technologies, including: \n\n C#, Visual Basic, Golang, IBM RPG, Vue.js, MySQL, RabbitMQ, Docker, and SQL. \n\n Requirements \n\n The developers who do best at Labatt must have the ability to think both strategically and tactically, the discipline to set and hit deadlines, an appetite for hard work and continuous personal improvement, a passion for working and effectively communicating with others, and a commitment to the success of the overall organization. \n\n Proficiency in coding and the ability to write clean, functional code is a must. We understand that developers learn and use different technologies over time. We are more interested in finding developers who can think and write code and are less interested in \"X years with Y technology\". No matter the starting skill level, developers are expected to improve over time. \n\n A bachelor's degree in Computer Science or related field is required. \n\n Send resume to hr@labattfood.com",
