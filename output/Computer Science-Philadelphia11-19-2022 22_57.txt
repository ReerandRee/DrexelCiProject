The work environment is casual and, for the most part, informal. Expectations are high and excellence is encouraged and rewarded. We strive to make sure that we have a team-oriented group that can also work well independently. If you enjoy working in a high freedom, high demand environment with a small but talented group of people this may just be the job for you.\n \n  We offer a competitive benefits package including healthcare, a substantial number of paid days off (PTO), a generous profit-sharing plan, and access to our Flyers season tickets for yourself and a guest (if you're local, or visiting). We're a great group of people doing exceptional things for our customers and having fun doing it. Like any emerging growth company, this will be hard work, but more importantly, it will be fun and immensely rewarding. We think you already know if this is a position for you, and if so, we look forward to reviewing your application!\n  \n  \n  If you think it’s you we’re looking for, send us your motivational cover letter and resume.
