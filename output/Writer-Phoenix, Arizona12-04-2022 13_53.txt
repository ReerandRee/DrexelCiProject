  "description": "Paddle Board Reviewer / Staff Writer\nLocated in beautiful St. George, Utah, SUPBoardGuide.com is a leading authority on stand up paddle boarding. We are a consumer-oriented company dedicated to, among many other things, guiding SUP newcomers as they learn about the sport, lending a hand to experienced paddlers as they look for their next board, and helping brands grow while challenging them to make a better product.\nWe set ourselves apart from our competition by being nuanced and detailed, and expect our contributors to be experts in their respective fields. SUPBoardGuide.com’s reputation as a reliable source for beginner and expert paddlers has been growing for several years, and we’re looking for a new team member who loves to paddle and also loves to review stand up paddle boards.\nSUPBoardGuide.com is one of three outdoor and fitness review sites operated by the company. Our reviewers test each product that is sent to us, compare it vs competing boards, and do their best to help consumers know the pro’s, con’s, best use cases, and if that board is right for them. They also are responsible for providing constructive feedback to the brand so they can in turn improve their product in future models.\nIn an industry where it’s very difficult to try out a paddle board, we think of ourselves as a place people can go to learn how a board will actually feel and perform in the water before they buy it.\nThe best part about it? We live and work in one of the most beautiful corners of Utah. Zion National Park is just a stone’s throw away, Las Vegas is two hours to the south and Lake Powell is two hours to the east.\nJob Description:\nSUPBoardGuide.com is seeking a new Product Reviewer/Staff Writer to join our team. This person will be responsible for researching and testing the various stand up paddle boards and writing in-depth, high quality reviews on each product. They will also need to be comfortable on camera for video reviews.\nThis position requires the person have (or be able to develop) the skills to review products both in written and video form, and create other educational content (paddle boarding guides, ‘best lists’, how-to posts, etc.). You will need to be a champion for the stand up paddleboard industry while making sure our readers are kept informed and are guided towards the best possible equipment for them. The foundation of any good product review website is its content, and as one of the main contributors to SUPBoardGuide.com you are responsible for that foundation.\nYou will:\n\n Thoroughly test boards and equipment on our home reservoirs, lakes and rivers in southwestern Utah.\n Write in-depth reviews of those products.\n Work with our team to determine which products should be ranked on our best lists and where.\n Frequently do on-camera reviews of SUPs and equipment for our YouTube channel and website.\n Create content for and answer questions on social media channels.\n Generate content ideas based on SEO needs (targeting keywords, link building)\n Write additional content, such as:\n Industry news pieces\n Blog posts\n Website copy\n Company profiles and reviews\n Develop great relationships with other industry leaders and manufacturers\n Help the website increase targeted traffic and social traffic in order to increase affiliate sales.\n Be an all-around expert in stand up paddleboarding.\n\nSUPBoardGuide.com currently caters to both entry-level, recreational paddlers, and to veteran paddlers looking for tips and tricks, industry news or help determining what specialty board best suits them. That’s why a SUP background is so important — you need to know your stuff.\nIn an increasing market of direct-to-consumer retailers and big-box stores that makes it difficult for consumers to know a product more than its spec sheet, our goal is to be the resource that helps them understand everything they need to know before making a purchase.\nA good candidate will:\n\n Be a lover of all things stand up paddle boarding. You spend your weekends paddling and would prefer to spend your weekdays doing it too (we might be able to help with that last part). Experience and passion for other water sports like surfing and/or kayaking may also work.\n Preferably be a college graduate with a Bachelor’s degree in communications, marketing, journalism or a journalism-related field.\n Have 1-3 years experience as a professional journalist or writer, or a recent graduate with serious writing skills and enthusiasm to learn.\n Be a passionate self-starter. You can follow directions but don’t necessarily need them to create interesting, polished content.\n Be comfortable on camera. Video reviews are a good chunk of what we do.\n\nWhere:\n\n This role is based at our headquarters in St. George, Utah.\n As a primary function of this job is hands-on product testing, a candidate will be expected to live in or relocate to the St. George area.\n\nWhat we offer:\n\n Competitive salary, depending on experience\n Future growth opportunities. We want you to earn raises every year, and as you help us grow you will also have growth opportunities.\n 12+ paid holidays per year. Paid holidays for 2022 include: New Year's Day\n\nMartin Luther King DayPresident’s DayMemorial DayIndependence DayLabor DayThanksgivingBlack FridayChristmas Week (December 24th through January 1st)\n\n 12 PTO (paid time off) days\n Fun environment, where you get to be one of a very small group of people across the entire nation who test stand up paddle boards.\n\n*We do not currently offer medical insurance or 401K\nJob Type: Full-time\nPay: $50,000.00 - $65,000.00 per year\nBenefits:\n\n Paid time off\n Relocation assistance\n\nSchedule:\n\n Monday to Friday\n\nApplication Question(s):\n\n This job is located in St George, Utah.
