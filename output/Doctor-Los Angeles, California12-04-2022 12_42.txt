MICHAEL MARCIN, MEDICAL DIRECTOR FOR CALIFORNIA\nMichael S. Marcin, MD, MSCR, is a double-boarded child and adolescent and adult psychiatrist with nearly two decades specializing in treating youth and adults with complex and comorbid neurodevelopmental disabilities.

As past Medical Director of Adult Outpatient Services at Langley Porter Psychiatric Hospital and Clinics (LPPHC) and full HS Clinical Professor in the Department of Psychiatry, he focused on expanding access and delivery of mental health services across the adult outpatient programs, teaching residents and medical students in how to best serve patients with mental health struggles, and treating patients with co-morbid neurodevelopmental disorders.
