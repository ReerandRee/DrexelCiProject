  "description": "\n \n  Decoded, now part of Media.Monks and S4Capital, is a full-funnel marketing, advertising and design company creating breakthrough campaigns with unrivaled performance. Challenging convention, it took some of the best talent from strategy, creative, media, design and the DTC world and put together a new way of working to bridge the gap between meaningful storytelling, data-led optimizations and commerce. Decoded services global clients like T-Mobile, Intuit, Visa, CareerBuilder and SC Johnson from its offices in New York and Los Angeles. \n \n Roles and Responsibilities \n  Although specific positions (Art, Copy, Design/Craft) will dictate an ACD's undertakings, there are several core responsibilities common to the role at Decoded. \n  Concepts \n  ACDs will work alongside the Creative Director to develop concepts and directions for creative ideas, campaigns, executions and positionings. This will require them to make conceptual and stylistic decisions. Creating comps, ad lobs and prototypes may be required to illustrate their idea to other members of the team or management. This work can be done in conjunction with teams they are delegating to or working with. \n  Managing Projects \n  Decoded ACDs will oversee multiple projects at once. This will include managing creative teams, abiding by timelines, overseeing direction, ensuring all deadlines are met. They will also act as quality control for their projects by reviewing and editing their team's work before it is seen by the larger agency group or clients. \n  Client Presentations & Presentations \n  The ACD's management of any given project gives them the best purview to craft the initial story around how an idea is sold to clients. It's expected that the ACD will organize the work coming in from teams and create presentation decks for review both with those teams and their managers. \n  Staying Curious \n  ACDs are muses as much as they are teachers. Staying up on the latest trends and social media fads is important for them to help guide the conversation with their teams, but it's only the start. An encyclopedic knowledge of all sorts of influences will make your work more effective.
