  "description": "\n Do you have experience as a Welder, Deckhand, Mechanic, Electrician, Construction Worker, or Laborer?\n \n  Have you been looking for a way to get into the maritime industry?\n \n  Do you want to work for a company that rewards hard work, where YOU determine your career path?\n \n  Then Curtin Maritime is the place to be.\n \n  We are looking for highly motivated individuals to join our Maritime Training Program. This program allows employees to move through three levels of training, and from there, YOU decide what’s next!\n \n  \n   Have you always imagined a life on the water? Pick the Deckhand path, and get the opportunity to become an Engineer, Mate, or even Captain! \n  Do you have welding experience, or have you graduated from a welders program? Let's start your career as a Maritime Welder! \n  Prefer to stay on shore, but still make a huge difference? We’ve got a variety of shoreside paths to choose from.\n \n  \n  \n  The objective of the Maritime Training Program is to produce skilled workers who are self-motivated and willing to pass the “Curtin Heart Check.” It will be important to prove your willingness to learn and work hard to advance through the training program. As you begin to demonstrate your awareness and understanding of entry-level labor concepts, you will advance through the program.\n \n  These apprentice positions will be required to perform routine physical labor with supervision including but not limited to: Moving materials, tools/and or equipment; cleaning equipment, vehicles, machinery and work area; performing additional duties as deemed necessary by the supervisor for the completion of the job in a safe and timely manner.\n \n  Who we are looking for: \n  We are looking for people who are looking to quickly advance through hard work, dedication, and a positive mental attitude. This position is ideal for anyone looking to train and advance in the marine construction industry.\n \n  Where you will work: \n  Our Maritime Training Program employees work at our Long Beach, California shipyard. Travel is also REQUIRED for this program. While our headquarters are in the Port of Long Beach, we do work all over the country, and the world. There may be times when we have an \"all hands on deck\" situation at one of our job sites, so we will fly our apprentices out to that location, often on short notice.\n \n  When you will work: \n  The Maritime Training Program schedule is Monday - Friday, 7 a.m. - 3:30 p.m. There may be times where overtime is needed (after hours, weekends, holidays).\n \n  Full Disclosure: \n  The work is hard, the hours are long. The travel (while exciting at first) can be draining. A career at Curtin Maritime will be the most demanding thing you've ever done. It will also be the most rewarding and fulfilling.\n \n  If you like what you've read, and are ready to join us, APPLY TODAY!\n \n  Curtin Maritime is an equal opportunity employer.
