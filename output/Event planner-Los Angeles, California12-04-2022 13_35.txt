Creatively brilliant but have a big habit of over-scheduling myself and taking on too much hands-on work with clients to ensure their satisfaction – all the things the driver of a company should be. But I’m now realizing I need to find my in-person counterpart, someone who can assist with mundane tasks where needed, who carries an extreme attention to detail, and can make sure things run to schedule.\nThe role will be subject to wide-ranging demands. As a taster, but by no means an exhaustive list, your day-to-day will include...\n- Working as a tag-team with me on events using Asana (must be familiar with it)\n- Management of my inbox and work cell phone when it gets too hectic – screening and responding to emails with clients and vendors\n- Client acquisition – research of prospective clients (aka digging up their email address) and assisting in the sales process. (Think the equivalent of ‘A&R’ from the music world.)\n- Social media savvy (because I do NOT have the time to post all my work on IG)\nAs you can see, this company needs someone who’s very good and well-rounded.\nWith initiative and drive, I want someone who can take over these things, as well as opportunities we don’t yet see, to grow their role.\n*\n2023 is a BIG year for the company. I’m wanting to expand the company in huge ways, and in no way will this role be short-term. If anything, I want a candidate who someday wants to be the COO of this company because they’ve been with us from the beginning.\nThe position will start at 10-15 hours per week. After 12 months the role will be full-time and soon after will switch to a monthly salary.\nThe ideal candidate is based in the Glendale area, has a car, is not tied down and able to travel freely, and is available to work in my home or a local coffee shop 3-4 days a week.\nIf interested, please write back with a short letter noting your experience and why you think you would be a good fit. Do not send a CV of any kind; I’m not interested in where, or even whether, you went to school – all that matters is that you can do it. ;)\nI won’t be able to get back to everyone, but for those who stand out, we will set up a call next week. (Expect responses starting Monday)\nI am VERY excited about having this person on my side. It’s been a long time coming. The successful candidate will become an integral part of our company. Like any assistant position, they’ll be in a role of deep insight and intimacy, and it’s one we’ll be selecting for carefully.\nThank you for considering the position.\nBest of luck and I look forward to hearing from you,\nSamantha\nJob Type: Part-time\nPay: $18.00 - $20.00 per hour\nSchedule:\n\n Weekend availability\n\nApplication Question(s):\n\n Are you able to work weekends?\n\nExperience:\n\n Asana: 1 year (Preferred)\n Event Planning: 2 years (Preferred)\n\nWillingness to travel:\n\n 25% (Preferred)\n\nWork Location: Hybrid remote in Glendale, CA 91208",
