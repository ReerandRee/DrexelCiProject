Legal writing is a pivotal part of each entering student’s first-year courses, as it comprises a total of five credit hours (separate and apart from an additional two-credit legal research course). During the first-year legal writing course, students fine-tune their grammar knowledge and writing style, while mastering the basic skills associated with objective and persuasive writing. The Director of Legal Writing, the Assistant Director of Legal Writing, and our Writing Resource Specialist, together with a team of highly successful practicing attorneys, jointly teach all first-year students UNT Dallas College of Law’s unified writing curriculum. This team-based teaching approach allows students extensive one-on-one contact with full-time professors and practitioners, while ensuring that students receive extensive feedback and have abundant writing resources if extra help is needed.\n        \n        EXPECTATIONS\n        Adjunct faculty members will be a critical part of the College of Law’ learning community, and will be involved in curricular and co-curricular activities and programs relating to student learning and professional formation throughout law school. Legal Writing Adjuncts are expected to prepare for and attend their classes, to provide rigorous and detailed feedback on student work, to complete required trainings, and to work cooperatively.\n        \n        Because the educational program will strive for excellence in developing practice-related competencies, adjunct faculty members will be expected to follow the instructional and\n        curricular practices of the College of Law, including use of the Canvas Learning Management System, learning outcomes, multiple assessments, and research and\n        writing modules within a course, as appropriate, with support from other faculty as well as research librarians.
