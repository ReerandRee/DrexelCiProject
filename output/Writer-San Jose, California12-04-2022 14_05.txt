To take Cisco into new markets, and especially towards new personas - both buyer and user. And like building a startup from the ground up, it's all about having an entrepreneurial mindset. Taking an idea from a crazy thought, to a product that solves a critical need, to an experience that delights users and customers. It's about innovation. From 12 months out to 5 years in the future. Wearing multiple hats. Failing and learning, fast. About challenging assumptions and finding new ways of solving problems. Driving form ambiguity. About creativity. We are looking for entrepreneurs. Thinkers. Designers. Marketers. Product Led Growth experts. Business Development, SDRs, Customer Success. Product Managers, SWEs, SREs. Data Scientists and ML engineers. Yes, we are building the next set of startups with the support of a trusted name like Cisco. Where else will you get to do this? We are Cisco ET&I. We run bold, we run agile, and we run ambitious. Come create with us.\n   \n  \n  \n   \n     Learn more about us at https://eti.cisco.com.\n   \n  \n  \n \n  Who You'll Work With\n  \n \n  The team is a highly visible group which reports directly to Cisco’s CEO. ET&I focuses on the next wave of innovation by anticipating, investing in, and incubating new technologies and business ventures. You will be part of the incubation team to develop new products and bring them to market in a startup-like environment.\n  \n \n  What You’ll Do\n  \n \n  As a tech writer at Cisco on products maximising cloud-native, edge and AI/ML technologies, you will:\n  \n \n  Use your outstanding writing skills and extraordinary attention to details to conceptualize, plan and develop rich information experience. \n  Drive innovation and experiment with new-age content formats, information architecture, and work-flow driven, minimalist content. \n  Find opportunities to improve quality, usability, and efficiency. \n  Gain an in-depth understanding of customer asks through internal/external connections to drive innovative content development and delivery methods. \n \n \n  Who You Are\n  \n \n  5+ years of experience defining information architecture documenting complex technical products, \n  Creative and critical thinking skills to solve customer problems, \n  Ability to learn about new products, technology, and tools quickly, \n  Ability to accept change, find opportunities, and take initiative, \n  Knowledge of Agile & Lean startup methodologies, \n  Experience with Git/Github, Markdown, Linux, Confluence. \n \n \n  Why Cisco\n  \n \n  #WeAreCisco, where each person is outstanding, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an inclusive future for all.\n  \n \n  We embrace digital and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!\n  \n \n  But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)\n  \n \n  Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, aggressive steps, and take the difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.\n  \n \n  So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots?
