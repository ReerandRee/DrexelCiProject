Operated since that time by succeeding generations of the same family as a dairy farm, most of the striking views that typify the heart of southern Chester County's exquisite hunt country were preserved and even enhanced when, in 1962, White Manor Country Club bought the land from the Evans family and created its new home. Today, White Manor is where you will find one of the country's most beautiful and challenging golf courses. Redesigned and renovated in 2003 by renowned, award-winning course designer, Bobby Weed, the course is highly rated and appreciated by all who have the pleasure to play here. More than high-quality golf, White Manor has a reputation for both fun and refinement coming from an active, vibrant membership that enjoys a country club experience that ranges from casual to elegant, from family-focused to adult. Membership at White Manor begins with the camaraderie of men and women who set high standards for themselves and their club. They simply expect the best. White Manor gives it to them.\n",

You'll learn new things, get recognized for your efforts and learn skills that last a lifetime. \n\n What are we looking for? \n\n The good news is that your training will teach you everything you need to know to succeed on the job. But there are a few skills you should have from the get-go: \n\n \n \n You're a fun and friendly person who values customers and takes absolute pride in everything you do. Communication skills are key – you’re not going to be able to text message customers back and forth. In other words, you should be comfortable talking to strangers. \n You've got attitude - the right kind of course - and understand the need to be on time, all the time. With loads of energy, you understand that work is easier – and more fun – with some teamwork. \n And you’re at least 16 years old – 18 if you want to be a driver \n We’ve got great jobs for people just starting out in the workforce, looking for a flexible second job or staying in the workforce after retirement.
