  "description": "\n Voyage is seeking an Registered Nurse who possesses a Pediatrics specialty and is able to go to Mesa, AZ. This position requires travel to the assigned location.

What must you do to commence a travel nurse career? \n \n  Travel nursing provides adventure, numerous choices, and flexibility. Our nurses can select a facility and geographic location that is their preference and have the opportunity to work in prestigious facilities. Since many nurses are trying to find a quality life style, the capacity to choose is crucial. To a great extent, travel nurses have the ability to be in control of their schedule. Many of our travelers have been employed in travel nursing in excess of 10 years and have intentions to continue traveling for quite a while. \n   If you are a medical professional who is looking for a very good salary, choices in your schedule, and exciting locations then a travel career may be suitable for you. So how can you commence? \n   Get Prepared For The Steps In The Process \n   Before commencing with your first travel assignment some preparation is needed. Be certain to update your RN license, if needed and make sure you have a complete immunization and physical examination records. Your CV should display your nursing skills and experience and you should have several reference who can be easily contacted to vouch for you. \n   When you have identified a number of assignments you are interested in, your recruiter will submit you for them and you can get ready for the interview process. During the interview, you should inquire about things of importance to you such as scheduling, patient to nurse ratios, required skills, and so forth. \n   State Licensing Requirements \n   Getting an RN license in a particular state can commence before having an assignment lined up. If you have some states where you are considering working you can begin the licensure process beforehand. There are a few states that take over a month to process, like, California, New Jersey, and New York. Many other states will quickly process RN license applications, often in a few days. \n   There are a number of states where you can obtain your RN license in one day, simply by going to the state nursing board directly. \n   The process of getting an RN license will be much easier if you have a license in a state that is part of the Nurse Licensure Compact, that has 25 states as members. This compact permits nurses to practice in any of the 25 compact states. Your recruiter will give you a hand in obtaining a license in your chosen state. There are experts who are knowledgeable in RN licensing procedures who will help you. \n   Your Area Of Expertise \n   Each facility maintains its own policy, but normally you need a year or more of solid experience in your area of specialization to be considered. \n   Even though requirements vary between facilities, you can start to apply for travel positions once you have a year of continuous experience. \n   You should be aware that there are a few specialties, such as psychiatric Registered Nurse and cardiac ICU where the experience requirement is over 2 years. \n   Versatility \n   Along with your skills and experience it is vital that you have the ability to be flexible. This trait is a crucial component of being a successful travel nurse. \n   You should be amenable to several kinds of hospital policies, procedures, and locations so you can gain additional skills as part of your travel experience. \n   Although your first selection may have been an assignment in Hawaii, you shouldn’t allow a fantastic opportunity in a different location slip away. Most of the time your contract will be for 13 weeks, making it straightforward to try several cities within a one year time frame. \n   Job References and Skills Checklist \n   A crucial portion of your application is your set of clinical references, and you should make sure they are readily available before you apply for a job. References are needed to confirm your clinical skills, in most cases three references will be sufficient. \n   A travel nurse will customarily be required to fill out a skills checklist coupled with their references.. \n   After your references and skills set have been addresses we can start seeking contracts that match your requirements. When you have decided to accept a job we will help you take care of any added details such as immunizations and drug testing.\n \n\n \n\nCertification: Registered Nurse Specialty: Pediatrics Location: Mesa, Arizona Jobs Available: 1 Job Type: Contract",
