It began the day he broke his father’s wooden mallet. The mallet had been crafted by Stan’s father when he was a kid, on his own father’s Shopsmith lathe. Stan was devastated and rushed to grab a piece of firewood. He carefully took the wood, placed it on his father’s Shopsmith-and in that moment, his passion for carpentry was born.Today Acton Construction is a Design-Build company with enthusiasm for crafting beautiful homes that are functional, lasting, and charming. Acton Construction thrives through established processes and utilizing expertise to provide customers with certainty, transparency, and value-always. This is Acton’s legacy.\n",
