The company’s portfolio includes many of the world’s most respected and influential media properties including Vogue, Vanity Fair, Glamour, Self, GQ, The New Yorker, Condé Nast Traveler/Traveller, Allure, AD, Bon Appétit and Wired, among others. Condé Nast Entertainment was launched in 2011 to develop film, television and premium digital video programming.\n \n \n   Job Description\n \n \n \n   Location:\n  New York, NY\n \n \n   SELF is seeking an experienced writer and reporter with a strong background in science-based wellness and lifestyle content to help us shape those beats. This writer will be responsible for publishing roughly 4-5 articles per week on a range of topics that fall under the wellness and lifestyle umbrella, including sex, relationships of all kinds, beauty, and mental health and well-being, among others. The ideal candidate will be highly skilled in service journalism and write in a voice that’s authoritative but friendly, funny when appropriate, and always empathetic—in other words, \n  human.\n \n \n \n   We’re looking for a writer with a lot of ideas who is excited to create nuanced wellness content that’s genuinely helpful and inclusive—someone who gets that self-care isn’t just about bubble baths and doing sheet masks or how often you go to the gym. You should have a robust background covering everything from relationships to therapy to sex to skin care. You should also be able to explore these topics in a thoughtful, complex, voicey way, and have a rich list of qualified experts in these spaces to reach out to—or a solid idea of how to find them. Equally as important, you have excellent fact-checking skills, scientific literacy, and a deep understanding of what evidence and sourcing are necessary for accurate and fair wellness coverage. You pay close attention to the conversations about wellness that are happening in media, online, and IRL, and have thoughts and opinions about how to add value, information, compassion, representation, inclusivity, and cultural competence to those conversations.\n \n \n \n   You should also be comfortable handling multiple stories at once, all at various stages of the writing process (planning the outline for one, scheduling interviews for another, reporting one, and working on edits for another). You’re comfortable reaching out to sources at major organizations and interviewing people at the top of their fields (whether they’re academic or medical experts, book authors, therapists, or celebrities), but you also know when you need to take a step back and dig into the research.\n \n \n \n   SELF is wellness you can trust. Our mission is to help people live healthier lives, whatever that looks like to them. We do that through focusing on four key brand values: inclusivity, accuracy, empathy, and autonomy. And we’re looking for people who share that vision when it comes to creating wellness and lifestyle content.\n \n \n \n   Primary Responsibilities:\n \n \n  \n   \n     Pitch and write (or update) 3–4 articles per week, focusing on wellness and lifestyle content.\n   \n  \n   \n     Follow the news and cultural conversations in the wellness space to pitch and turn around timely stories quickly, reaching out to experts for quick comment when necessary.\n   \n  \n   \n     Fact-check and edit content before turning it in to the top editor and/or research team.\n   \n  \n   \n     Package content in an engaging way to appeal to new and loyal readers across platforms.\n   \n  \n   \n     Contribute writing and brainstorming for larger SELF initiatives as the need arises.\n   \n  \n   \n     Attend industry events on an as-needed basis.\n   \n  \n   \n     Write or contribute to newsletters as needed.\n   \n \n \n \n   Requirements:\n \n \n  \n   \n     At least 3 years of relevant writing experience, specifically reporting on wellness topics that require a good amount of fact-checking\n   \n  \n   \n     A background in service journalism, ideally as it relates to wellness and lifestyle (sex + relationship and/or beauty reporting expertise is a plus)\n   \n  \n   \n     High scientific literacy and deep understanding of health reporting best practices\n   \n  \n   \n     Ability to write and edit clean copy in a fast-paced environment, ideally delivering content that’s conversational, approachable, and establishes a clear point of view\n   \n  \n   \n     Ability to pitch endless story ideas that are timely, shareable, thought-provoking, and as clicky as they are editorially sound\n   \n  \n   \n     Strong understanding of—and experience participating in—the digital health and wellness landscape\n   \n \n \n \n   Base Salary Range: $65,000 - $100,000\n \n \n \n   What happens next?\n \n \n   If you are interested in this opportunity, please apply below, and we will review your application as soon as possible.

  "description": "Mediator seeks a journalist to help run our PR agency.\nRead more about my agency: https://mediatoragency.com/\nMediator's approach to getting our clients into the news is informed by founder Michael Simonson's background as a journalist.\nTo elaborate, before pitching journalists, Michael interviews his PR clients as if he was a New York Times reporter. He doesn't merely ask clients superficial questions about what makes their business special. Instead, he asks about clients' personal lives, the actual amount of money their businesses generate (and the actual amount of profits they make), and other questions that will give him enough material to write a pitch that actual New York Times reporters will find compelling.\nLike a journalist, Michael also transcribes what his clients say during these interviews - word for word. Then, he takes what he's written - and combined with a little bit of additional research - writes a handful of very short email pitches designed to get journalists to open up and respond.\nBecause of Michael's journalistic approach to PR, Mediator has had a lot of success getting our clients into the biggest publications - and on the biggest outlets - in the country: The New York Times, NBC Nightly News, MSNBC and CNN primetime, and many many more.\nSo if you have experience as a journalist, and want to try out PR, apply here.

Work Location \n New York \n Expected duration \n 6 MONTHS Duties and Responsibilities \n ORGANIZATIONAL SETTING AND REPORTING   In its Resolution A/RES/72/279, the United Nations General Assembly endorsed the transformation of the UN Development Coordination Office (UNDCO) as a stand-alone coordination office within the United Nations Secretariat. The new DCO assumes managerial and oversight functions of the resident coordinator system under the collective ownership of the members of the United Nations Sustainable Development Group (UNSDG).   To improve development coordination, facilitate data harmonization and demonstrate the UNSDG’s contribution to Agenda 2030, DCO established the online UN INFO system. UN INFO digitizes a standard results framework based upon the United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework guidance but must be able to adapt to the unique coordination, reporting and user requirements of each UNCT.¿¿   BACKGROUND AND CONTEXT  Achieving the Sustainable Development Goals requires a “business unusual” approach, moving beyond traditional siloed solutions to address crosscutting issue and involving a broad range of partners. For this reason, Member States called for a UN development reform to boost coordination and coherence for a more effective UN team support to countries to achieve the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The Decade of Action to achieve the SDGs requires the UN to work differently and to communicate differently too, more strategically and effectively, what we are doing on the ground.   As UN country teams are mobilising to support national responses to the multifaceted impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, we are also seeking to build additional capacity to tell the story of the work of the Resident Coordinator System (RCS) and how our teams on the ground are mobilising to support government and local partners, including in ensuring that countries accelerate progress towards the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals.   The objective is to encourage more stories from the field that tell what the UN team is doing on the ground to support countries achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, including in building resilient communities in the aftermath of a crisis like COVID-19.

Stay with me… We’re a boutique marketing firm with a big heart and a wondrous imagination! Our clients love us just as much as we love them. Our people are a force of nature who run through walls for each other, our clients, and sometimes strangers (yes, strangers - we shall discuss that in your interview).\nWe are strategic and tactical, social and traditional, and barely tolerate business jargon. So don’t come at us with “circle back,” “ecosystem,'' and “satisfy the end user” in your interview or ever, we just may accidentally hit the “End Meeting” button on Zoom...oopsie! We’re totally chill but hyper-focused. We’re humble enough to say the quiet part out loud: sometimes marketing doesn’t work. We also know that stuff that doesn't work can serve us… sounds complicated? It’s really not… another thing we’ll chat about in your interview.\nWe care deeply about the world we live in, and that’s why election days are paid days off, we recycle, and do pro-bono work for not-for-profit organizations. We start thinking about lunch around 9:30 AM, so bring a serious and discerning palate with you. If you don’t have a culinary game, don’t worry, you’ll get one working here, and in no time you’ll be transformed into a food snob worthy of judging any food competition on the Food Network. Oh, we get out early on Fridays when we can, and don’t use air quotes.\nIf the following sounds like you, we’d love to meet you.\nYou’re positive, energetic, and you want to push yourself. You’re honest to a fault. If you’re a troll, please click on the next job description right now, and good luck in your job search. You get back to everyone by email, phone (we use phones here), slack, text, in real friggin’ time. You have an imagination and use it as a force for good! You love to story tell, write, and produce great content. Type-os are your worst enemy, and you sometimes have to bite your tongue from correcting your friends’ grammar. You are enthusiastic about social media, you know what makes a great marketing email, and you make strangers feel like old pals.\nNow for the boring but important stuff:\nResponsibilities\n\n Copywriting, and editing required— email, social, press release, websites, and other copy\n Manage client social media accounts and content calendars\n Assist with the implementation of various projects for the marketing team\n Answer phones and emails responsibly\n Assist with scheduling\n Contribute new ideas for communications around Verasoni’s clients\n Support marketing team and your position with tasks as needed\n\nQualifications\n\n 1 – 2 years experience\n Excellent copywriting and editing skills\n Marketing or communications background preferred\n Comfortable in a fast-paced environment\n Hard-working and a willingness to “roll up your sleeves”\n Ability to think critically and strategically\n Excellent communicator & team player\n\nPreferred Technical Toolbox (Or willingness to learn)\n\n Copywriting\n Copy Editing\n Email Clients (Constant Contact, MailChimp, Hubspot)\n Social Media Platforms (Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn)\n Google Analytics & Google AdWords\n Hootsuite\n\nJob Type: Full-time\nPay: $32,228.81 - $42,000.00 per year\nBenefits:\n\n 401(k)\n Flexible schedule\n Health insurance\n Paid time off\n\nSchedule:\n\n 8 hour shift\n\nSupplemental pay types:\n\n Bonus pay\n Commission pay\n\nAbility to commute/relocate:\n\n Parsippany, NJ 07054: Reliably commute or planning to relocate before starting work (Required)\n\nExperience:\n\n Marketing: 1 year (Preferred)\n Copywriting: 1 year (Preferred)\n\nWork Location: Hybrid remote in Parsippany, NJ 07054",
