Opportunities exist from San Francisco South to Los Gatos, and Santa Cruz, and east to Fremont. ACC maintains its' own regional office to track practice quality, preoperative evaluation, credentialing, scheduling, and revenue cycle management. In-house scheduling provides for both flexible and equitable scheduling with direct access to the full time scheduler.   \n The ACC practice model is to partner with established, and new, facilities with long term growth potential. Therefore, compensation is productivity based and only varies by skill level, work performed, call, and vacation taken by the individual anesthesiologist.

There is a formal onboarding program with active mentoring at all sites.\n  \n  Opportunities exist in General, Regional, part-time Cardiac Anesthesia (fellowship not required) and Chronic Pain. Hospital call is optional, separately reimbursed; and does not include OB or trauma. Healthcare benefits, 401K, CME allowance and paid malpractice are offered.
