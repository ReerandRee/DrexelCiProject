  "description": "Paddle Board Reviewer / Staff Writer\nLocated in beautiful St. George, Utah, SUPBoardGuide.com is a leading authority on stand up paddle boarding. We are a consumer-oriented company dedicated to, among many other things, guiding SUP newcomers as they learn about the sport, lending a hand to experienced paddlers as they look for their next board, and helping brands grow while challenging them to make a better product.\nWe set ourselves apart from our competition by being nuanced and detailed, and expect our contributors to be experts in their respective fields. SUPBoardGuide.com’s reputation as a reliable source for beginner and expert paddlers has been growing for several years, and we’re looking for a new team member who loves to paddle and also loves to review stand up paddle boards.\nSUPBoardGuide.com is one of three outdoor and fitness review sites operated by the company. Our reviewers test each product that is sent to us, compare it vs competing boards, and do their best to help consumers know the pro’s, con’s, best use cases, and if that board is right for them. They also are responsible for providing constructive feedback to the brand so they can in turn improve their product in future models.\nIn an industry where it’s very difficult to try out a paddle board, we think of ourselves as a place people can go to learn how a board will actually feel and perform in the water before they buy it.\nThe best part about it? We live and work in one of the most beautiful corners of Utah. Zion National Park is just a stone’s throw away, Las Vegas is two hours to the south and Lake Powell is two hours to the east.\nJob Description:\nSUPBoardGuide.com is seeking a new Product Reviewer/Staff Writer to join our team. This person will be responsible for researching and testing the various stand up paddle boards and writing in-depth, high quality reviews on each product. They will also need to be comfortable on camera for video reviews.\nThis position requires the person have (or be able to develop) the skills to review products both in written and video form, and create other educational content (paddle boarding guides, ‘best lists’, how-to posts, etc.). You will need to be a champion for the stand up paddleboard industry while making sure our readers are kept informed and are guided towards the best possible equipment for them. The foundation of any good product review website is its content, and as one of the main contributors to SUPBoardGuide.com you are responsible for that foundation.\nYou will:\n\n Thoroughly test boards and equipment on our home reservoirs, lakes and rivers in southwestern Utah.\n Write in-depth reviews of those products.\n Work with our team to determine which products should be ranked on our best lists and where.\n Frequently do on-camera reviews of SUPs and equipment for our YouTube channel and website.\n Create content for and answer questions on social media channels.\n Generate content ideas based on SEO needs (targeting keywords, link building)\n Write additional content, such as:\n Industry news pieces\n Blog posts\n Website copy\n Company profiles and reviews\n Develop great relationships with other industry leaders and manufacturers\n Help the website increase targeted traffic and social traffic in order to increase affiliate sales.\n Be an all-around expert in stand up paddleboarding.\n\nSUPBoardGuide.com currently caters to both entry-level, recreational paddlers, and to veteran paddlers looking for tips and tricks, industry news or help determining what specialty board best suits them. That’s why a SUP background is so important — you need to know your stuff.\nIn an increasing market of direct-to-consumer retailers and big-box stores that makes it difficult for consumers to know a product more than its spec sheet, our goal is to be the resource that helps them understand everything they need to know before making a purchase.\nA good candidate will:\n\n Be a lover of all things stand up paddle boarding. You spend your weekends paddling and would prefer to spend your weekdays doing it too (we might be able to help with that last part). Experience and passion for other water sports like surfing and/or kayaking may also work.\n Preferably be a college graduate with a Bachelor’s degree in communications, marketing, journalism or a journalism-related field.\n Have 1-3 years experience as a professional journalist or writer, or a recent graduate with serious writing skills and enthusiasm to learn.\n Be a passionate self-starter. You can follow directions but don’t necessarily need them to create interesting, polished content.\n Be comfortable on camera. Video reviews are a good chunk of what we do.\n\nWhere:\n\n This role is based at our headquarters in St. George, Utah.\n As a primary function of this job is hands-on product testing, a candidate will be expected to live in or relocate to the St. George area.\n\nWhat we offer:\n\n Competitive salary, depending on experience\n Future growth opportunities.

Denny Sanford committed $100 million to the creation of the Sanford Stem Cell Clinical Center (Sanford Center) at UC San Diego. This gift established the Sanford Center, a $286 M program to accelerate development of drugs and cell therapies inspired by and derived from current human stem cell research. These advancements establish, promote and disseminate clinical trials and patient therapies that will help more quickly transform promise into reality.\n         Sanford Stem Cell Clinical Center (Sanford Center) is among the University’s most highly visible and top priority interdisciplinary and multi-institutional programs. Sanford Center provides essential physical and human resources needed to leverage stem cell research currently being conducted at UC San Diego. Due to the complexity of regenerative medicine projects and substantial institutional investment, on a daily basis Sanford Center personnel works with a large variety of departments in Health Sciences, Health System, and the school of engineering.\n         As part of UC San Diego Health, Sanford Center motivates University-wide change and sustainability, focusing on creating the structure under which various innovative regenerative medicine units and initiatives are developed. Sanford Center has led several successful and highly visible interdisciplinary faculty recruitments, committing to over $48M towards faculty start-up, retention, and research funds for over 25 faculty members. Sanford Center also played a pivotal role in securing over $77M of grants from California Institute of Regenerative Medicine (CIRM), awarded respectively to dept. of Bioengineering, Pediatrics, Cellular & Molecular Medicine, Medicine, Neurosciences, and Sanford Center. \n        Sanford Center integrates its clinical operations at two UC San Diego medical centers - Jacobs Medical Center (JMC) and the Koman Outpatient Pavilion (KOP) - encompassing 12 inpatient beds and outpatient exam rooms.

  "description": "\n Overview: \n \n   KPBS News serves a countywide audience with news, information, cultural, and entertainment programming. KPBS is the public media station for San Diego with a mission to be the premier source of local news and information for the San Diego region.\n \n \n \n   The Freelance News Editor ensures we prioritize accountability-driven coverage, and include a mix of thought-provoking stories as well as fresh explainers that teach the audience something new. KPBS is committed to providing quality local in-depth news and news analysis on all of its platforms – TV, Radio, Web and Mobile. The mission of the news division is to provide balanced, accurate reports about the people and issues of import affecting San Diego & Imperial Counties and its citizens.\n \n \n \n   The Freelance News Editor works under the supervision of the Director of News & Editorial Strategy (DNES) to manage the day-to-day coverage of news and to edit/review daily news on radio, TV and online, assigning stories, news planning, reporting and editing for radio, TV, and the web and supervises reporters and their daily assignments. \n Responsibilities: \n \n   The following information is intended to be representative of the work performed by incumbents in this position and is not all-inclusive. The omission of a specific duty or responsibility will not preclude it from the position if the work is similar, related, or a logical extension of position responsibilities. Job descriptions may be changed at any time based on the needs of the department.\n \n \n \n   Freelance News Editor:\n \n \n \n   Assigning/Editing News: The Editor works with the DNES, Senior News Producers and reporters to develop story ideas that cover issues with major impact in our audience’s lives; lively explainers that explain story behind WHY a trend is happening, and breaking news. The Editor encourages pitches, and helps hone them and carefully selects the ones that best match the KPBS news mission.\n \n \n \n   The Editor ensures writing is focused, spare, and conversational (if you wouldn’t speak it, don’t write it), at times irreverent, and audio and video for broadcast stories should move the narrative forward, allowing the writer to “get out of the way” of stories that appear to unfold spontaneously. Help reporters not only to write with style, but to create audio-rich radio, write to the pictures in the video, and adapt stories creatively for the web, as “top five” lists, a budget game, rich election guide, etc..\n \n \n \n   The Editor will ensure reporters start their stories online, or helps them team up in breaking news to split up platform coverage if necessary. The News Editor is responsible for the on-air and web news being timely, balanced and accurate, and is always pushing the envelope with the quality of our content and engagement, in collaboration with Senior News Producers, the Editor and the DNES.\n \n \n \n   In partnership with the Senior News Producers and the Digital Editor, the Editor ensures a multimedia approach to all stories is a priority for all local content to reach diverse KPBS audiences. Assigning and editing duties will periodically fall on weekends and evenings and as news coverage requires. The News Editor is the back-up for the Digital Editor, and vice versa.\n \n \n \n   Administration:\n \n \n \n   The Editor maintains news planning documents by updating with reporter movements and assignments, upcoming news pegs, and air/release dates of station news stories. The Editor compiles and distributes daily rundowns of planned coverage for KPBS news partners, with the assistance of the Newsroom Coordinator. The Editor apprises the DNES of errors and necessary corrections, audience feedback, and any high-stakes story situations that entail potential legal action, anonymous sourcing, or ethical issues. The Editor will also coordinate stories shared with KPBS news partners, including the PBS NewsHour, NPR, and our various projects.\n  Qualifications: \n \n   Knowledge & Abilities\n \n \n   Knowledge of video production techniques\n   Knowledge of full range of production techniques including sound recording, graphics, television, photography, video taping, lighting, editing methods and equipment\n   Ability to set up and operate a wide variety of production equipment including set-up for multi-camera video productions\n   Ability to learn techniques in the development of television, film, radio or multimedia productions\n   Ability to use and maintain studio, camera and related equipment\n \n \n   Education/Experience\n \n \n   Bachelor's degree or equivalent work in a related field\n   6 months of experience in still and motion picture photography, including a thorough knowledge of video production techniques\n \n",
