They are the ambassadors of the restaurant to numerous guests and tourist visitors from around the world. They represent local pride and provide great hospitality. They are knowledgeable about our food, beverages, merchandise, history, and culture. They have a good to the fluent command of English language. They greet and serve guests in a fast, efficient and polite manner. They make sure each and every guest is taken care of and happy when they leave. They are great team members who support their co-workers and supervisors in achieving common goals and genuinely care about the team. \nAll of our employees can come from different backgrounds and walks of life, but what we are looking for is something special, that will allow them to blend in seamlessly with the existing crowd of greatness. \nHere are a few attributes you must be pretty sure you posess if you think a job with us is not going to be just a waste of your, and our time: \n\n 1. You are reliable.

If you can't admit weakness, confess mistakes or ask for help from others, this will be a difficult place to work. Everyone makes mistakes, but being able to accept it and let the more experienced team members teach us, will make a big difference in our ability to learn and grow. \n5. You are diplomatic and wise in communication. You often think about and have a good understanding of the impact your words, body language, and attitude have on people. You are naturally aware what and when might be good, or not good, to say. \n\n Please take a minute to think about the above qualities and ask yourself if this kind of workplace that will push you to project them is what you are looking for. We respect that everyone does not have the same preference when it comes to this. We think it is very important to come to work with joy- and we strongly believe that people who would not find themselves at home with the above qualities will not enjoy working here and would not prosper. \n\n Special Instructions \n\n Harlem Shake is an Equal Opportunity Employer. \nPlease do not send any emails, resumes, or call. \nWe are making it really easy to apply for this position. \n\n Simply submit a ZippyApp application package which may include the Common Employment Application, Resume, and a Cover Letter.
