# Apify
Using Apify, we are able to use an API that scraps the Indeed jobs website. 
The code in Apify.py current iterates through a list of jobs and a list of cities, calling the worker job with each combination separately. All of the results are written to a csv file with data that will need to be uploaded to our database.
