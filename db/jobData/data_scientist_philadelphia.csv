38,Quantitative Researcher – Graduate,Susquehanna International Group,"Bala-Cynwyd, PA","We’re looking for accomplished researchers who are interested in growing their career in the field of quantitative finance. The type of problems we solve at SIG are often different from the subject of your PhD thesis, but nonetheless, our problems demand the attention of brilliant minds that have an extraordinary attention to detail and a relentless pursuit of understanding.

The general lifecycle of a quant project begins with an idea:

This idea can come from anyone: you, the mentor who sits beside you, or someone you meet in the cafeteria.
As a Quantitative Researcher, you will investigate that idea by immersing yourself in market data, leveraging tools in mathematics, statistics, and programming.
Through your research, you may discover a new pattern that can transform into a trading signal.
You will work side-by-side with technologists in order to backtest your results and put that trading signal into production.
Once that signal is embedded in our electronic trading strategies, you will continue to do research on that strategy in order to optimize its performance.
As your trading strategy evolves, you will discuss with other researchers, strategists, and traders to collect feedback and brainstorm new ideas.
Some of those ideas will turn into new quant projects, and the life cycle starts all over again.

What we're looking for
PhD or Master's degree in a quantitative field such as Mathematics, Physics, Statistics, Electrical Engineering, Computer Science, Operations Research, or Economics
Exceptional mathematical problem-solving skills
Solid communication skills, both in the ability to understand others and to make yourself clearly understood
Strong, practical computing skills; a specific language proficiency is less important than your ability to get computers to accomplish tasks efficiently and reliably
Experience working on in-depth research projects
Finance experience is a plus, but not required

Our client believes that the next leap forward in applied AI lies in active learning systems and techniques like reinforcement learning. These systems are ‘curious’ – they continuously try new things in the world, making them better at adapting to and operating in a fast-changing, complex world.

Our customers turn to us every day—online and at 1,500 branches in 44 states—to help them take control and improve their financial lives with solutions for debt consolidation, medical expenses, household bills, home improvements and auto purchases. Our talented and dedicated team members constantly look for responsible ways to serve our customers when, where and how they want. It’s all about doing the right thing—a mission that hasn’t changed for more than 100 years.

The Role
OneMain Financial is seeking a Lead Data Science Analyst to join our innovative and fast-moving Data Science team. Become part of a growing and highly collaborative team of data science experts who are dreaming, designing, and building the future of financial services. Return to the joy of data science by working with diverse data and using modern open-sourced tools, in an environment where projects get implemented quickly. We accomplish in weeks what the big banks take quarters and years to do. Do you like data? We love it! We have aggressively explored alternative data including open banking products, and currently have many in production.
This is an exciting opportunity to have direct impact on customers and the business as you build, deploy, and improve data science solutions across our diverse portfolio of products and services. Example projects include building next generation underwriting models for our core personal loans business, building a credit line management model for our new credit card business, building a pricing model for our emerging auto purchase finance business, and building a contractor fraud detection system for our recently launched point-of-sale business.

Successful candidates will demonstrate a solid track record of creative problem solving, technical expertise, integrative business thinking, teamwork, and bias for action. One must also have a strong model risk management orientation – skilled in using “black box” approaches yet skeptical / experienced enough to not blindly trust them. A successful candidate will expand competencies and grow business and industry acumen, as well as demonstrate the ability to work on complex processes or projects across the end-to-end project cycle. They will also gain knowledge to suggest new answers to old questions, develop insights and push the traditional boundaries of the lending industry.

Research and develop new data, tools, and techniques that will keep OneMain at the forefront.
Unlock insights from non-traditional data sources such as information from other industries, tax data, deposit data, demographic data, social media and digital data.
Apply diverse statistical and machine learning techniques to analyze a variety of datasets to solve complex, unstructured business problems
Actively contribute to our team’s vibrant culture through sharing knowledge, helping peers, volunteerism, and generally being a great person to work with.
Develop creative technical solutions to improve the company’s decision making, the customer’s experience, and shareholder return
Understand the data environment to appropriately prioritize and set expectations for key reporting, modeling, and analytical priorities.
Qualifications
Bachelors Degree in a quantitative discipline (Engineering, Statistics, Biostatistics, Physics, Economics, Operations Research, or Computer Science)
3-5+ years of machine learning solutions development and implementation experience in consumer lending financial services or insurance; Masters or PHD degrees may offset experience.
Applied experience in a variety of modeling techniques like bagging, boosting, deep learning, NLP and so forth.

As an Associate Director, you will own the data science solutions that drive the decisions impacting millions of our customers and nearly $20 billion of loans. You will assume ownership of an existing set of machine learning models for our personal loan business and will be charged with reimagining them to leverage new, diverse data sets and advanced algorithms.

This leader must also have a strong model risk management orientation – skilled in using “black box” approaches yet skeptical / experienced enough to not blindly trust them. Since this leader will be charged with both building the future while delivering impact in the present, one must have both the skills and orientation to get “hands on” and the ability to mentor other data scientists who they will work with.
Responsibilities
Partner with business leadership to imagine, design, and deliver the machine learning systems needed to produce great customer and financial outcomes.
Reimagine and transform current practices and processes into cloud based adaptable machine learning systems.
Drive research and exploration of new data sources, modeling techniques, and problem formulations to deliver sizable business impact in Loss Mitigation.

Work with external data providers to test new data and develop strategies for inclusion into the Loss Mitigation processes.
Effectively prioritize competing initiatives across stakeholders, translate strategic priorities into a roadmap of initiatives, and manage expectations.
Qualifications
Master’s Degree in a quantitative discipline (Engineering, Statistics, Economics, Biostatistics, Physics, or Computer Science). PhD preferred.
5+ years of machine learning solutions development and implementation experience in consumer lending financial services, insurance, or marketing; PHD degrees may offset experience.

Why GSK?
We’re uniting science, technology and talent to make a difference in more people’s lives, and revolutionising the way we do R&D.
We’re combining the power of genetic and genomic insights into what causes disease, with the speed and scale of artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) to make better predictions about who a treatment might work for, and why. We believe this powerful combination of data and technology holds the key to fundamentally transforming medical discovery for the better, improving R&D success rates and shaping how even the most challenging diseases, like neurological conditions and cancer, can be both prevented and treated.
No single scientist, nor any one technology can keep us all ahead of disease. That’s why we build important collaborations with commercial and academic partners to advance our understanding of disease and what it takes to get ahead. In the past three years, we’ve doubled the number of partnerships we’ve signed, because of our belief in their significant impact on our process.
Our pipeline currently comprises of more than 60 vaccines and medicines across four core therapeutic areas including infectious diseases, HIV, oncology and immunology as well at pursuing other science-led opportunities outside our core areas. Many have the potential to be first or best-in-class opportunities for patients and since 2017, we’ve delivered 13 major approvals and more than doubled the number of potential new vaccines and medicines in Phase 3 and registration to 23.
In 2021 we delivered four major product approvals: Cabenuva for HIV, Jemperli for endometrial cancer, Xevudy for COVID-19 and Apretude, our new long-acting medicine for HIV prevention.
We give our scientists the freedom to own the process. Our scientists often use genetic data to help us understand the root cause of disease. We steer the research where the data shows we can do the most good. If a project doesn’t pan out, we take what we’ve learned and apply it elsewhere.
